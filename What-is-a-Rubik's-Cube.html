	<h1>What is a Rubik's Cube</h1>
	<p>A Rubik's Cube, originaly called the Magic Cube, is a cube with dimensions of 3x3x3. The objective is to make it so that all six sides are the same color.</p>
	<p>This may sound easy, but all you can do to achive this goal is spinning the six sides. If you don't have a cube yet you can buy them on Amazon or at some stores.</p>
	<p>The shape of Rubix Cubes may vary, and not all cubes are 3x3x3. For example, there is a 4x4x4, a 5x5x5, and even a pyramid.</p>
